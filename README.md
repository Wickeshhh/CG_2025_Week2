## üìñ Overview

This week aimed at strengthening your understanding of how Java leverages OOP principles to design flexible, reusable, and scalable code. You explored constructors, access specifiers, object references, static/final behaviors, and various types of inheritance through practical code examples.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

### [Day 1: Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week2/tree/master/Day1-Java%20Constructors%2C%20Instance%20vs.%20Class%20Variables%2C%20Access%20Modifiers)
- Understanding constructors and their types (default, parameterized)
- Instance vs. class (static) variables
- Access modifiers: `private`, `public`, `protected`, and default
- Use of access control in encapsulation
- Code samples to demonstrate scope and initialization

### [Day 2: this, static, final keywords and instanceof Operator](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week2/tree/master/Day2-this%2C%20static%2C%20final%20key%20words%20and%20instanceof%20Operator)
- Using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object
- Declaring static fields and methods
- Understanding the `final` keyword for variables, methods, and classes
- Using the `instanceof` operator for type checking

### [Day 3: Single and Multilevel Inheritance](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week2/tree/master/Day3-Single%20and%20Multilevel%20Inheritance)
- What is inheritance and why it's used
- Single inheritance (subclass extending a single superclass)
- Multilevel inheritance (a class derived from a derived class)
- Method overriding and use of `super` keyword
- Inheritance code examples and diagrams

### [Day 4: Hierarchical and Hybrid Inheritance](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week2/tree/master/Day4-Hierarchical%20and%20Hybrid%20Inheritance)
- Hierarchical inheritance (multiple classes inheriting from one superclass)
- Concept of hybrid inheritance using interfaces
- Real-life modeling with inheritance trees
- Java's approach to avoiding ambiguity using interfaces

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Week 1 knowledge of Java basics
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
